"""Service layer for subscription business logic.

This module contains ALL business rules and logic for subscriptions.
It orchestrates repository calls and transforms data into API-ready formats.

Key Concepts:
- Subscription: A user's active subscription to a plan (Free, Pro, Enterprise)
- License: An active LicenseAssignment that tracks usage limits and counters
- Quotas: Resource limits (products, AI credits, views, galleries) and their usage
- Free Plan Fallback: If user has no active license, we return free plan defaults
  This ensures all users always have subscription information, even new users.

Architecture:
- Repository: Fetches raw data from database
- Service: Applies business rules, calculates quotas, formats responses
- Route: Orchestrates service calls and returns HTTP responses
